### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs need to be thought out in depth. They need to be fully flushed out and thought of before coding anything. This allows for the project to be measured and doesn't leave that openess that can lead to projects never reaching production. User stories lay out clear step by step instructions for how the application should function for the user. They flush out how the application should function.

### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Taking the agile approach is what I will be doing in projects from now on. It allows for the project to be more flushed out and the continous development is great for having an application last. I hope to incoporate more sprints into my future work. 

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member you must be open and honest. Communication is the key factor to being a great team member. Being able to access your own abilities and be honest with not only yourself and others lends you to be a great team member.
